## **Introduction**

Cloud computing has revolutionised the way businesses operate, offering unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. By enabling resources to be shared across multiple users globally, cloud computing can maximise resource effectiveness, boost computing power, and reduce environmental damage. However, the environmental effects of cloud computing are drawing increasing scrutiny, necessitating action from business and IT leaders. It's estimated that the sector's proportion of global emissions is between 3% and 4% annually and could double by 2025. Despite its ethereal image, cloud computing relies heavily on physical infrastructure, including hardware, cables, cooling systems, and rare metals, all of which contribute to its environmental footprint.

*   **Reliance on Physical Infrastructure:** Although it may seem intangible, cloud computing depends on hardware, cables, fans, servers, storage arrays, routers, switches, computers, smartphones, and rare metals.
    *   **Servers and Data Centres:** The backbone of cloud computing consists of servers and data centres, each of which utilises a substantial amount of energy.
*   **Environmental Concerns**: The increasing usage of IT infrastructure around the globe has led to an increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions, which is a worrisome situation for everyone because of its direct effect on the environment.

## Major factors affecting environment in Cloud Computing 

### **Energy Consumption**

Cloud computing's voracious appetite for energy is one of its most significant environmental impacts. The continuous operation of data centres, which house the servers and infrastructure necessary for cloud services, requires massive amounts of electricity. This energy demand not only contributes to greenhouse gas emissions but also strains energy resources.

*   **Data Centres as Major Consumers**: Cloud computing and data centres have become major carbon emission drivers, responsible for about 1.8% of U.S. electricity consumption and a significant portion of tech companies' emissions.

    *   **Cooling Requirements**: Data centres consume large amounts of energy for cooling and powering operations, contributing to environmental harm and carbon dioxide emissions. Cooling systems typically require billions of gallons of water each year to keep servers at optimal temperatures, straining local water demand, particularly in water-scarce areas.

### **Carbon Emissions**

The carbon footprint of cloud computing encompasses both direct and indirect emissions. Direct emissions result from the energy consumed to power and cool data centres, while indirect emissions stem from the manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of IT equipment.

*   **Sources of Emissions**: Both direct and indirect carbon emissions are accounted for in cloud computing's carbon footprint. Data centres produce direct emissions through power consumption and cooling system operation. Indirect emissions come from servers, networking devices, and their production and disposal.
*   **Growing Demand**: The trending need of cloud infrastructure has drastically scaled up the energy need of data centres, leading to high carbon emissions. IT produces almost 1 gigaton of emissions a year, about 2% of total global emissions, estimated to become 1.54 gigatons or 3% by 2020.

### **E-waste:**

The rapid turnover of IT equipment in cloud computing generates a substantial amount of electronic waste (e-waste). Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to environmental contamination and health hazards due to the release of toxic materials.

*   **Lifecycle Impacts**: Cloud computing relies on a broad array of electronic equipment, producing a substantial amount of electronic waste. The production, maintenance, and disposal of IT equipment can affect the natural world if not managed properly.
